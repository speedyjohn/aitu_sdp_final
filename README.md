# This is a final project for Software Design Patterns course in Astana IT University
### Project is done by Ismail Ragimov, Sergey Tarshilov, SE2307
In this project we used MVC architecture
Patterns that we used for this work:
1. Creational Patterns:
   - Singleton
   - Factory
2. Sctructural Patterns:
   - Facade
   - Decorator
3. Behavioral Patterns:
   - Observer
   - Strategy
This project provides some real business logic by using SQLite database.
We decided that we need this to show some oppurtunities of our project.
Our main endpoint is an infinite cycle, which asks us what to do.
